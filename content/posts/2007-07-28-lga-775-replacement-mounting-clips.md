I've been trying to find these blasted mounting clips for the stock intel socket lga775 heatsink/fan units for the better part of the last month.

If you've ever tried to install them, or even worse, remove the heatsink after a not-perfect installation, you'll know why I need replacements. They break easily! Well, after spending a few hours looking at complete new replacement heatsink units and noting that half of them use these pins in the first place, I renewed my search and finally found a forum post link directly to the intel site where they sell them in packs of 4!

Voila, [Kit Fasteners for LGA775 fan heatsinks (set of 4)](http://shop.intel.com/shop/product.asp?pid=SIPS1052&pfid=116&pindex=1&mscssid=78D2EFD2VXPC8K6T73HFRDK7JJ6GC735)

Now, if only their store would work ... grrrrrr.
