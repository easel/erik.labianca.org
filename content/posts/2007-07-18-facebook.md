So I've been following the Scobleizer every now and again via Google Reader, and he just won't stop going off about facebook. I signed up a while back, but without a community and not finding anybody on there I knew, I gave it up. However, he's right. Facebook applications are pretty darn cool, and might even motivate me to finish tweaking my blog and actually publish on a regular basis. The google reader application is cool at least. So, there you have it. Now if I could just find 1/2 as many people I know on facebook as I have found on MySpace I'll be pleased!
