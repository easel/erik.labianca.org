Sun has really been pushing innovation with Solaris recently, and since it&#8217;s now freely available and open sourced, what better time to give it a test drive? With the Solaris Express Nevada 49 release (get it from http://www.opensolaris.org/os/downloads/on/ and click the CD Version or DVD Version links under step 3b) Sun has officially included their BrandZ extension to Solaris containers. BrandZ allows containers to be &#8216;Branded&#8217;, the upshot of it is that you can run an entire system under a lxrun-like technology. 

Currently they fully support running CentOS 3 in a zone, which conveniently enough is what all our production services still run on. See http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/brandz/install/ for the official howto guide. Here&#8217;s how to I set up a CentOS 3 development system for testing on my SNV49 machine:

    
    #zonecfg -z centos3-dev-2
    
    centos3-dev-2: No such zone configured
    Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone.
    
    zonecfg:centos3-dev-2> create -t SUNWlx
    zonecfg:centos3-dev-2> set zonepath=/tank/centos3-dev-2
    zonecfg:centos3-dev-2> add net
    zonecfg:centos3-dev-2:net> set address=192.168.2.31/24
    zonecfg:centos3-dev-2:net> set physical=e1000g0
    zonecfg:centos3-dev-2:net> end
    zonecfg:centos3-dev-2> commit
    zonecfg:centos3-dev-2> exit
    
    
    
    #zoneadm -z centos3-dev-2 install -d /tank/public/centos_fs_image.tar.bz2
    
    
    cannot create ZFS dataset tank/centos3-dev-2: dataset already exists
    Installing zone 'centos3-dev-2' at root directory '/tank/centos3-dev-2'
    from archive '/tank/public/centos_fs_image.tar.bz2'
    
    This process may take several minutes.
