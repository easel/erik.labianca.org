I&#8217;d heard in passing that Larry Ellison announced Oracle was going to start selling Red Hat Linux support, and that Red Hat stock and dropped like 43% in a day because of it, but the gravity of the situation never sank in.

Then I checked out their](http://www.oracle.com/technologies/linux/ubl-faq.pdf) and things became more clear. In my opinion, Red Hat is really going to have to pony up or risk losing a lot of business. Why? Pricing! Oracle is going to give out free binary downloads (why oh why didn&#8217;t Red Hat do that?) and their basic &#8216;just updates&#8217; service is $99/year for unlimited cpu&#8217;s. They&#8217;re also discounting their Basic Support to $199 per year for up to 2 cpu&#8217;s, which appears to entail 24&#215;7 phone support. I&#8217;m not sure exactly what premier support is, and what &#8216;back ports of fixes to earlier releases&#8217; entails, so I&#8217;ll refrain from comment on that but suffice it to say that given Red Hat doesn&#8217;t return my calls when I try to purchase their product, let alone actually get support, I&#8217;m pretty interested in an alternative.

In any case, $100 bucks a year and the base platform for free is pretty compelling pricing. Giving out the binaries is a huge step. Regardless of how great you think open source is, nobody can use it without binaries. Refusing to give out &#8216;real&#8217; binaries without a support contract is assinine business in my opinion. How do you expect to get people hooked on your product if they can&#8217;t even try it out for free? And we wonder why Ubuntu is taking over the linux hobbyist space?
