So, as it happens, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of &#8216;research&#8217; lately. Such that it is, a lot of my &#8216;research&#8217; ends up being on the web, and a lot of information comes from blogs, so I decided I&#8217;d best get with the program and start posting what I&#8217;ve been up to on the web as well. Not that I expect it to be interesting to anybody else, but at least I&#8217;ll start to accumulate the stuff I find somewhere more useful than a browser cache!

Right now, the primary areas of my &#8216;research&#8217; are storage and virtualization. The last time I went around this merry-go-round it was VOIP, so perhaps I&#8217;ll get around to trying to consolidate some of what I&#8217;ve picked up on that front as well. We&#8217;ve recently been nailed with some hardware failures at Interlink and I&#8217;m really hoping that the latest round of storage and virtualization hype will help me to insulate us from service outages and spending the amount of time I have attempting to resurrect systems with a soldering iron and box of new fans. Interlink is a pretty small company, but we&#8217;re more and more dependant on the Internet. This puts us in an interesting position, in that we don&#8217;t really have the bankroll to play with &#8216;Enterprise&#8217; hardware, but our dependance on the internet (and computing services in general) is high enough that we really can&#8217;t afford to take the usual small business &#8216;buy a dell and stick it in the corner and hope it doesn&#8217;t die&#8217; route.

As it happened, VMWare had just released the final version of the their newly free &#8216;VMWare Server&#8217; product when one of my machines died in the rack, and I&#8217;d been evaluating it for a while, so I got a crash course in &#8216;putting VMWare into production&#8217;. Unfortunately, in my case, just about every issue I&#8217;ve had with VMWare seems to be IO related, so the interest I&#8217;d had in moving beyond our Dell Windows Storage Server NAS to a real storage system was piqued.
